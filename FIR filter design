FIR (finite impulse response) design 
In this part we want to design a FIR filter. Designin a DT filter with the same specification az those of the previous example.
In the first place we must calculate several parameters such as A,M, Î² and of course w[n] shape then we multiply to a sinc function then we have desire h[d]
